# [Botpress](https://botpress.io) ‚Äî The only sane way of building great bots

Botpress is an open-source bot creation tool written in Javascript. It is powered by a rich set of open-source modules built by the community. We like to say that **Botpress is like the Wordpress of Chatbots**; anyone can create and reuse other people's modules.

## What is Botpress

Botpress is on a mission to make useful bots ubiquitous by powering developers with the best possible tools to build & manage chatbots. We believe that in order to create great bots, major time should be spent on UX, **not** on the surrounding (and generic) features. 

Botpress is a free & open-source bot-building platform that ships with:
* [**Connectors**](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=botpress-connector) to the major chat platforms
* [**Modular ecosystem**](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=botpress) with over 29 modules
* [**Flow-management**](https://botpress.io/docs/foundamentals/flow.html) system
* **Graphical interface** to edit and manage your bot in production
* **Notification centre** to see what's hapenning with your bot
* [**Data persistence**](https://botpress.io/docs/foundamentals/database.html) to database
* [**Built-in API**](https://botpress.io/docs/modules/api.html) to integrate with external systems

<a name="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpUmDz9kRY"><img alt="Botpress" height="150" src="assets/youtube_tutorial.png"></a>

## Installation

Botpress requires [node](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 4.6) and uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) as package manager.

```
npm install -g botpress
```

## Creating a bot

Creating a bot is simple, you need to run [`botpress init`](https://botpress.io/docs/reference/cli.html#init) in a terminal inside an empty directory:

```
botpress init my-bot
```

Once your bot is created, you need to run [`botpress start`](https://botpress.io/docs/reference/cli.html#init) to start your bot:

```
botpress start
```

This will provide you locally a web interface available at **`http://localhost:3000`**

## Adding stuff to your bot

At this point, your bot does nothing, you need to add features. There are two ways to add features:
- Installing modules
- Coding

### Installing modules

For example, there's a `botpress-messenger` module that will make your bot connect to Facebook Messenger and easily send/receive messages.

You can install modules directly in the web interface, or by using the [`botpress install`](https://botpress.io/docs/reference/cli.html#install) command:

```
botpress install messenger
```

Once installed, modules expose two things:
- A graphical interface (available in the left panel). This makes configuration easy and convenient. You don't need to know about coding to use the graphical interface.
- Features via APIs. Each module has a detailed documentation on how to use their API.

### Coding to add features

As the number of modules increase, we expect that the amount of code you'll need to write will lower everyday. Developers can add code directly in the bot (i.e. `index.js`) and access the core and modules features. For example, if you wish to respond to a `GETTING_STARTED` event on Facebook Messenger, you might code something along these lines:

```js
bp.hear({ type: 'postback', text: 'GETTING_STARTED' }, (event, next) => {
  bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'Hello, human!')
})
```

To create a basic Hello Human bot in one minute, please read the [Getting Started](https://botpress.io/docs/starting/setup.html).
