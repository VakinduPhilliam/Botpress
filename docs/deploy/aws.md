  6. (Step 4) In health checks select protocol http and put a path to health status. (The AWS will ping this url to check if the server is alive)

  7. Select the machines you want to put under this load balance (We created just one for this example) and create.

9. Install [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) to manage process

    `npm install -g pm2`
